Below is a list of additional readings as you continue to explore 'React hooks and custom hooks'.

In particular, to complement your learning in the 'Advanced hooks' lesson, you can work through the following:

* The useReducer hook reference in the React docs discusses the basics of useReducer, along with specifying initial state and lazy initialization. - https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer

* The React docs also has a reference on using the useRef hook which is a great example of various options that are available when working with the useRef hook. - https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef

* The Reusing Logic with Custom Hooks reference in the React docs discusses the dynamics of custom hooks and provides a few practical examples to complement the theory behind them. - https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks
